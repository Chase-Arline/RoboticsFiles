Gradle is a program-building service that is popular because it allows people to develop multiple build/test scenarios and it also automatically fetches dependencies (libraries your program needs to run)

The easiest way for us to add FRC-related libraries through gradle is to use VSCode with the WPILib plugin.
In VSCode, the WPILib plugin allows us to run a command called "Manage vendor libraries". Using this, we can either find ones that are online or retrieve ones where the dependency file has been put.
For FRC-Related vendor libraries, most companies will provide us with a *.json file. This file contains the online location of the library. After adding it to the correct directory (/Users/Public/FRC2020/vendordeps), we only neeed to then run the WPILib plugin and add "offline libraries". This will recognize the newly applied *.json file and automatically fetch the libraries for us. 

Gradle also is used to build/deploy the robot project.

While in the main directory of the project, there is a file called "gradlew". This is the gradle wrapper used for these build cases. 

To build the project, use a terminal (the one in VSCode or a separate one that is in the directory) and run "./gradlew build"
To deploy it, do the same but run "./gradlew deploy"

The first time running a gradle process is slow because it needs to start the entire gradle daemon (a process that normally starts up in the background and gets called on later to run tasks). 
After the first time, it should be pretty quick to build the project and deploy.
